## CN-Series Deployer
Python script to deploy Palo Alto Networks [CN-Series](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-0/pan-os-new-features/virtualization-features/cn-series-firewalls-for-securing-kubernetes-deployments.html) in Kubernetes native or OpenShift cluster.

The script will do the following tasks:
1. Check Panorama PAN-OS version and confirm its running version 10.0 or later.
2. Check Panorama if kubernetes plugin is installed. If not, the script will download and install the latest kubernetes plugin.
3. Check Panorama if the following is configured. If not, the script will add them to Panorama config.
    - Device Group.
    - Template Stack.
    - Log Collector Group
    
4. Add a service account to K8S. The service account to be used by the Panorama Plugin.
5. Configure Panorama plugin. And apply the license for the CN-Series.
6- Deploy the following on the k8s cluster:
    - Service accounts for CN-CNI and CN-MGMT.
    - Config map for CN-CNI, CN-MGMT, and CN-NGFW.
    - CN-CNI DaemonSet
    - CN-MGMT StatefulSet
    - CN-NGFW DaemonSet.

## Prerequisites

The best way to run this script is using [Panhandler](https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/skillet-tools/install-and-get-started-with-panhandler/ta-p/307916).

To run the script directly then you will need:
1. Python3
2. The following python modules (can be installed using: pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
    - pandevice==0.10.0
    - paramiko==2.7.1
    - paramiko-expect==0.2.8

## Usage

1. Import the repo into your panhandler
2. Run the skillet and fill the required fields and click submit (Make sure to add quotes if the value will contain space):
3. Wait for the skillet to download the required Python modules (pandevice, paramiko, and paramiko-expect).
4. Finally the skillet will deploy the CN-Series and configure Panorama.
